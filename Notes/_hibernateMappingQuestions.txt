*   When to use and how to establish One-to-One mapping ?

>>  Let's say you have two entities: 'Employee' and 'Laptop', in which either both or any one of them have reference to
    other object.

    In this case if we want to persist any of these objects, first we have to establish one-to-one relationship between
    them.

    Follow below steps to establish the one-to-one relationship.

    (1) Create the Employee Entity

        ```
            @Entity
            public class Employee {

                @Id
                @Column(name = "employeeID")
                @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
                private long id;

                private String name;

                @OneToOne(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
                @JoinColumn(name = "laptopID")
                private Laptop laptop;
            }
        ```

        In the Employee entity, we use the @OneToOne annotation to establish a one-to-one relationship with the Laptop.

        In @OneToOne annotation we have used 'cascade' attribute which is use to specify that whatever operation is
        done on this entity, the same operation will be done on associated entity (in this case it is Laptop). If we save
        employee entity, it will save laptop entity also due to which no need to explicitly save the laptop entity.

        we use @JoinColumn to specify the reference column name in the Employee table which will hold the reference of
        Laptop table

    (2) Create the Laptop Entity

        ```
            @Entity
            public class Laptop {

                @Id
                @Column(name = "laptopID")
                @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
                private long id;

                private String name;

                @OneToOne(mappedBy = "laptop")
                private Employee employee;
            }
        ```

        Here also in Laptop entity, we use the @OneToOne annotation to establish a one-to-one relationship with the Employee.

        It is mandatory to annotate the Employee field with @OneToOne annotation cause we have annotated Laptop field with
        the same annotation in Employee entity in 1st step.

        In @OneToOne annotation, we have given attribute 'mappedBy' as 'laptop' which will specify that linking of these
        two entity will be done by 'laptop' variable of other mapped table (Employee table in this case). By doing so,
        we are specifying that the foreign key that links the two tables will be in the Employee table.

        If we don't use 'mappedBy' attribute in any of the entity, then both the entity table will have a reference column
        or foreign key to reference other table.

    (3) Perform Database Operations

        You can now perform database operations using Hibernate to save, update, and retrieve Employee and Laptop entities,
        and the one-to-one relationship will be maintained.

        ```
            public static void main(String[] args) {

                // Create a Hibernate SessionFactory
                SessionFactory sessionFactory = new Configuration().configure().buildSessionFactory();

                // Open a session
                Session session = sessionFactory.openSession();
                session.beginTransaction();

                // Create a Person and Address
                Employee employee = new Employee("Alice");
                Laptop laptop = new Laptop("Mac");

                // Establish the one-to-one relationship
                employee.setLaptop(laptop);
                laptop.setEmployee(employee);

                // Save the Employee, which will cascade to the Laptop
                session.save(employee);

                // Commit the transaction
                session.getTransaction().commit();

                // Close the session and the SessionFactory
                session.close();
                sessionFactory.close();
            }
        ```

*   When to use and how to establish One-to-Many mapping ?

>>  A one-to-many mapping is used to represent a relationship between two entities in which one entity is associated
    with multiple instances of another entity for example a list of Employee associated with a Department.

    Follow below setps to establish the one-to-Many relationship.

    (1) Create the Employee Entity

        ```
            @Entity
            public class Employee {

                @Id
                @Column(name = "employeeID")
                @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
                private long id;'

                private String name;

                @ManyToOne()
                @JoinColumn(name = "departmentID")
                private Department department;
            }
        ```

        In the Employee entity, we use the @ManyToOne annotation to indicate that many Employee entities are associated
        with one Department entity.

        we use @JoinColumn to specify the reference column name in the Employee table which will hold the reference of
        Department table.

    (2) Create the Department Entity

        ```
            @Entity
            public class Department {

                @Id
                @Column(name = "departmentID")
                @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
                private long id;

                private String name;

                @OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL, mappedBy = "department")
                private List<Employee> employees;
            }
        ```
        In Department entity, we use the @OneToMany annotation to indicate that one Department can have reference to many
        Employee entity.

        It is mandatory to annotate the employees field of Department entity with @OneToMany annotation cause we have
        annotated department field of Employee table with @ManyToOne annotation in 1st step.

        In @OneToMany annotation, we have given attribute 'mappedBy' as 'department' which will specify that linking of
        these two entity will be done by 'department' variable of other mapped table (Employee table in this case). By
        doing so, we are specifying that the foreign key that links the two tables will be in the Employee table.

        Even if we don't use 'mappedBy' attribute in any of the entity, unlike one-to-one relationship only one reference
        column will be created.

        In @OneToMany annotation we have used 'cascade' attribute which is use to specify that whatever operation is
        done on this entity, the same operation will be done on associated entity (in this case it is Department). If we save
        Department entity, it will save Employee entity also due to which no need to explicitly save the Employee entity.

    (3) Perform Database Operations

        You can now perform database operations using Hibernate to save, update, and retrieve Employee and Department
        entities, and the one-to-many relationship will be maintained.

        ```
            public static void main(String[] args) {

                // Create a Hibernate SessionFactory
                SessionFactory sessionFactory = new Configuration().configure().buildSessionFactory();

                // Open a session
                Session session = sessionFactory.openSession();
                session.beginTransaction();

                // creating department object
                Department department1 = new Department("Engineering");

                // creating Employee object and associating department with the respective employee
                Employee employee1 = new Employee("Abhishek");
                Employee employee2 = new Employee("Ravi");
                Employee employee3 = Employee("Saurabh");

                // associating employees with their respective department
                List<Employee> employees = new ArrayList<>();
                employees.add(employee1);
                employees.add(employee2);
                employees.add(employee3);
                department1.setEmployees(employees);

                // Save the Department, which will cascade to the Employee
                session.save(department1);

                // Commit the transaction
                session.getTransaction().commit();

                // Close the session and the SessionFactory
                session.close();
                sessionFactory.close();
            }
        ```
